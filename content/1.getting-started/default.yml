  To create the required framework for your new site, use `bonsai --plant jasper`, the generator will create your framework in `./jasper`.
  To have a running webserver of your site while you develop it, run `bonsai --cultivate` from within your generated framework (`cd ./jasper`). A web server will start on port 5000, navigate to [localhost](http://localhost:5000) and get hacking
  
  When you save, add or remove files `bonsai --cultivate` will process your files, images, js, and css will be rendered into the `output` directory. This is so that they can be served using relative paths.
