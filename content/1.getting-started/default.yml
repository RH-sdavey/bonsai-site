:title: Getting started with Bonsai
:body: | 
  To run Bonsai you will need Ruby and Rubygems. If you're using a Mac the good news is that Ruby and Rubygems will already be installed.
  To install Bonsai, open Terminal.app and run `sudo gem install bonsai`.
  
  Once installed typing `bonsai --help` will display a list of available options.
      > bonsai --help

      bonsai, tiny and beautiful

        --plant [NAME]
        --repot       
        --cultivate   
        --version     
        --console     

  To create the required framework for your new site, use `bonsai --plant jasper`, the generator will create your framework in `./jasper`.
  
  Bonsai comes with a built in webserver to your site while you develop it, run `bonsai --cultivate` from within your generated framework (`cd ./jasper`). A web server will start on port 5000, navigate to [localhost](http://localhost:5000) and get hacking.
  
  When you save, add or remove files `bonsai --cultivate` will process your assets (images, js, and css), they will be rendered into the `output` directory. This is so that they can be served using relative paths.
  
  The Bonsai generator will create an index page, `.htaccess` for apache, `base.less` and a default [mustache](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache) template. 
    
    If you're uninterested in using [lesscss](http://lesscss.org), simply rename your `base.less` file to `base.css`. 
    
    Any `.less` files added to the `public/` directory will be processed with less.
    
  You don't have to use mustache either - Bonsai uses "[Tilt](http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt)", to use another templating engine, simply change the file extension.
  
  
  Bonsai decides to give you some defaults using tools that I'd consider the best available for a well designed hierarchical site.
