:title: How bonsai works
:body: |
  Bonsai uses a set of very simple conventions to handle content and templating. Everything is managed through the filesystem. There is no database, no admin interface. It's just you and your content.
  
      /site-name
        - content
          - index
            default.yml
        - public
        - templates
          default.mustache
          - partials
  
  ### Content
  All content is stored on the file system in the "content" directory, the folder paths that you use will imply the paths used on the final web site.
  
  For example, a page that was kept under `content/about-us/services` will have a permalink of "/about-us/services".
  
  For a page to be recognised, you'll need a `template-name.yml` file. The "template-name" section of the file name referrers to the template that will be used to render your page.
  
  #### Ordering and "Floating" pages
  
  Bonsai will order your pages within the "navigation", "children" and "siblings" arrays by the prefix given to its parent folder. `content/1.about-us` will be ordered before `content/2.products` but don't worry - this will be cleaned up and removed from the final permalink
  
  "Floating" pages are not present in the "navigation", "children" or "siblings" arrays. This can be achieved by _not_ prefixing the containing directory eg `content/about-us/services` with a digit.
  
  Each page that you create has access to a set of predefined variables as well as its content, you can use these to build complex navigation and get access to images or downloads stored for each page.
  
  #### Page variables
  
  | Variable  |                     |  
  |:----------|:--------------------|
  |children   | All of the non-floating pages underneath the current page |
  |siblings   | All of the non-floating pages at the same level. Does not include 'self' |
  |ancestors  | Each parent up the tree - Useful for breadcrumbing |
  |parent     | The direct parent page |
  |permalink  | The full routable path to the page, eg: `/about/our/services` |
  |slug       | The last chunk of a page name, can be used in HTML as an ID or className, eg: `services` |
  |name       | A titlcased version of the slug. This can be useful for use in navigation or links |
  
  
  ### Templates
  Templates are kept in the "templates" directory. All templates are rendered using [mustache](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache). For documentation about more templating, check the mustache readme or google group.
  
  ### Public
  All files kept in the "public" directory will be copied into the "output" directory. Any `.less` files will be processed using lesscss and will be renamed to .css
  When you run `bonsai --repot` to ready your site for deployment all the .css and .js files will be minified using the YUI compressor.
