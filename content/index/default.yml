  Bonsai builds dynamic web sites that run anywhere. Perfect for portfolios, catalogues and other image-heavy sites.
  
  There's no database or admin interface - just templates for the HTML, YML files for the content, and the file system defines the hierarchy. Upload the results and you're away.

  It's not aimed at blogs or text-heavy sites, but those where simple, well-defined hierarchies are the focus.

  Bonsai is designed to keep a clear separation between content and templates, following best web practices. It has been built with an emphasis on simplicity of use.
